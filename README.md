# CypherUsability

## Project Requirements
Your project should:

- Import the string library to access more characters.
- Share an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Include user input for the initialMessage (capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and keyboard symbols), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Include a for loop that cycles through each character in the initialMessage.
- Include a conditional statement that allows for multiple word messages.
- Define and call a function called encryptOrDecrypt() that stores a conditional statement to encrypt or decrypt the initialMessage based on user input.
- Define and call a function called wraparound() that stores a conditional statement to adjust the position of any wraparound characters.
- Share the shiftedMessage with the user.

## Extensions
You can extend your project further by:

- Add another usability feature.
- Add a while loop to repeat the program.
- Explore other ciphers.
